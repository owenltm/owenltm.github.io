## 2. About Me

### Bio
I’m **Owen Lwiantoro**, a mobile app developer who enjoys turning simple interactions into meaningful digital experiences. I’m passionate about creating apps that respond intuitively and make users’ lives easier.

My primary focus is on building mobile applications using Flutter and Kotlin. I also work on full-stack projects with Next.js and Laravel, giving me the ability to develop complete solutions from frontend to backend.

I’m eager to grow further in mobile development roles where I can contribute to building apps that are both functional and enjoyable.

Outside of coding, I unwind by playing racing and puzzle games — a fun way to recharge and keep my problem-solving skills sharp.
